# SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-06-23 (Tuesday) — refreshed ~21:50 Peru (full-day close)

## State
- **HEAD:** `2724987` (main, clean, `0 0` vs origin — all pushed)
- **OPEN tasks:** 50 (To Do 48 · In Progress 2 = TASK-186, TASK-190)
- **PK:** v3.53 · **Mode:** DRY_RUN · **Sentinel:** shadow
- **Market:** closed (after-hours, ~21:50 Peru).

## Done this session
- **TASK-178 → Done** — HYP-001 (crossover-short) **REGISTERED** in `docs/HYPOTHESES.md` (DRAFT→REGISTERED). Zero-discretion rule LOCKED: SHORT at drop-event d1_close, **exit = D5_Close (5 trading days, time-only, NO TP/SL)**, HOLD_DAYS=5, borrow 500%×5/365≈6.85% + slip 2%/side, GO only if full bootstrap CI profitable-for-short on n≥150 new events. Resolved §D↔PK-v3.21 drift: the ±10% is the dashboard **simulation** exit (sim/179), not the pre-registered rule (discovery = pure 5d close-to-close, verified vs INVESTIGATION_2026-06-12_II); D6-D15 rejected as untested. AC#1/#2 ✅ (172/177/PHASE0 clear). `ed55e1b` + `9bd34f3`. PK v3.49.
- **TASK-189 → Done** — `score_backtest.py` marked **RESEARCH-ONLY** (historical v1@77e3964 / v2@f3d96ca / v3-proposed snapshots); fixed misleading "current code" label on v2 (pre-TASK-188); inline notes point to the SSoT (overbought-only RSI). **Comment/docstring only — math byte-identical**, py_compile OK, suite 506 passed, stays CORE_UNSAFE/imported-by-nothing → zero live impact. AC#1 (mark research-only) + AC#2 (grep: only this file re-implements bell-curve RSI, documented). `97fd06b` + `a3b74be`. PK v3.50.

## Session 2 (evening 2026-06-23) — TASK-190 done & pushed (AC#5 pending)
A second working block this day, downstream of a full investigation chain
(edge-audit → status report → post_analysis-failure diagnosis):
- **Diagnosis:** `post_analysis.yml` collector failing/cancelled most days since ~6/16 — **root-cause = job `timeout-minutes:15`**; the last step (OHLC backfill) crossed the ceiling as monthly rows accumulated → GitHub killed the job (`docs/DIAGNOSIS_post_analysis_2026-06-23.md`).
- **TASK-190 (HIGH, In Progress) — fix shipped:** new workflow `backfill_ohlc.yml` (cron 16:45 Peru, own 25m timeout) runs `backfill_ohlc_v2.py --recent 2 --apply`; the backfill step was removed from `post_analysis.yml` so the collector finishes fast; PK v3.52. **Committed + pushed:** `96dcf50` (fix) + `2724987` (handoff flag). AC#1-4 ✅.
- **Gap-map (live read):** only **2 real settled-gaps** remain (`docs/GAP_MAP_OHLC_2026-06-23.md`) — APWC 6/18 (D2), HSPT 6/11 (D2-D5, suspected unfillable). The earlier "87% fill" was a stale-snapshot artifact (pending-legit rows counted as missing).
- **Local-only docs (deferred, NOT committed — Amihay handles separately):** `GAP_MAP_OHLC_2026-06-23.md`, `STATUS_2026-06-23.md`, `INVESTIGATION_2026-06-23_edge_audit_v1.md`, `INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY_v1.md`.

## Next frontier — ⚠️ TASK-166 live-verify is the FIRST action next session
- **TASK-166** — lineage sentinel `check_30` (`health_audit.py`) is **code+CI done** (`1ddf281`, TDD 17/17, suite 506, PK v3.48) but **stays To Do**. The open critical step is the **live-verify**: run `check_30(gc)` against a real settled `post_analysis` row (known-good) in a quiet/post-EOD window, confirm it reports INFO/WARNING correctly with no false drift. **Only after PASSED → `backlog task edit 166 -s Done`.** Do NOT mark Done before that.

## Blocked / watch-items (not actionable now)
- **TASK-179** (validate crossover-short on hold-out) — BLOCKED until **n≥150 new crossover events** accrue forward-only (~mid-July). The HYP-001 rule is locked (178), so validation runs clean when power is reached.
- **TASK-177 D7-D25** forward-only growth accrues through ~mid-July (re-glance then, no action).

## Other near-term frontier
- **TASK-136** (quota, HIGH) — next substantive candidate.
- **Decision-gates awaiting Amihay:** 141 / 174 / 127.
- **WAVE 5 needs AC definition:** 62 / 63 / 65 / 68 / 69 / 71 / 72.

## Notes
- This session: 166 commit (build-first, verify pending) + 178 register + 189 research-only. 5 commits total; main clean & synced.
- Roster/wave map: prior planning artifacts under `~/.claude/plans/`.

## ⏳ PENDING FOLLOW-UP (added 2026-06-23 ~21:35 Peru — AFTER this handoff was first written)
A later session (post-close) executed **TASK-190**; one item awaits **live verification**:
- **TASK-190 → In Progress — do NOT close without live AC#5 verify.** Isolated OHLC backfill into its own workflow `backfill_ohlc.yml` (cron `45 21 * * 1-5` = 16:45 Peru, timeout 25m) to fix the `post_analysis` 15min job-timeout; removed the backfill step from `post_analysis.yml`; PK v3.52. Committed + **pushed** (`96dcf50`, main `0 0` vs origin). AC#1-4 ✅.
- **⚠️ AC#5 LIVE-VERIFY PENDING — on/after 2026-06-25.** `backfill_ohlc.yml` first runs **2026-06-24 16:45 Peru**; it should close the 2 mapped gaps. Target in `docs/GAP_MAP_OHLC_2026-06-23.md`: **APWC 2026-06-18 (D2)** + **HSPT 2026-06-11 (D2-D5, suspected unfillable/delisted)**.
- **ACTION next session (trigger: Amihay says "אמת AC#5"):** run the read-only gap-map **locally** (creds are local-only → a cloud routine cannot do it, per open TASK-93). Re-run `backfill_ohlc_v2` candidate logic as dry-run over `--recent 2`. **REAL-GAP=0 (or only HSPT flagged unfillable) → `backlog task edit 190 -s Done`.** Any gap beyond HSPT → report BEFORE closing. Never close without this live check.
